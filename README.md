# Math Repository
This repository contains several packages that implement different mathematical algorithms in Go. These packages were created out of curiosity and a desire to organize my personal projects. Over time, my interest in mathematics grew, and I found myself learning about new topics and concepts on my own, such as number theory, algebra, and calculus.

While I am not formally trained in mathematics, I continue to study and grow my knowledge in this field. As such, there may be mistakes or inaccuracies in my implementations. However, I am always willing to learn from feedback and improve upon my work.

Unfortunately, I have had difficulty finding resources to help me with my pure mathematics interests. My teachers in university are often too busy to work with me, and as a first-year transfer student, I am still navigating where to look for resources. If you have any suggestions or resources that may be helpful, please feel free to contact me.

I would also love to collaborate with someone who shares my interest in mathematics. If you are interested in working together or have any feedback, please feel free to contact me.
